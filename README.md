# Arduino-storm-simulator
MaxMSP/Arduino Storm simulator

a small project i did for a 2 lesson course in creative coding and lighting.
we were each given a programmable LED strip (Adafruit neopixels) and had to make something with it.

i decided to make a cloud of stuffing material and stuff the neopixels in there. in this repository you will find a little arduino script to make the Led's flash randomly the longer you press a button.

added to this is serial communication to a max-patch to quickly play sounds from a library and create the illusion of a distand cloud making thunder and lighting.
it's not perfect but it was fun working with what i had on hand
